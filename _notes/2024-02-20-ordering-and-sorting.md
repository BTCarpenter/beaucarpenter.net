title: Ordering and Sorting to Your Advantage
---

Ordering data is a fundamental computer function. So low-level that you might not even give it a second thought. 

With any data set (emails, notes, journal entries, tasks) it's worth taking a moment to consider how you might use this to your advantage.

You can even apply your own ordering where you might not think. Some examples:

**Journal** - I keep all of my journal entries for a given year in one document. Typically you think writting from top to bottom. Jan-Dec. But one year, scrolling to the bottom of the document became an minor irritation. 

Instead, I flipped the order. New journal entries go at the top and old entries automatically end up towards the bottom. No more scrolling.

**Note Inbox** - You might even apply different sorts for different contexts. Throughout the week, my note inbox is sorted by newest first helps me get back to those things I captured not long ago. When processing my note inbox more thoroughly, it's helpful to switch to oldest note first to find the things I might have forgotten.

**Creating your own sort** - Finally, you might prefix a numeric order to apply your own sort to alphabetic items. For example my primary document folders are:

- Projects
- Areas
- Resources
- Archive

Sorted alphabetically it lacks the prioritization I want and actually puts archive at the top!

- Archive
- Areas
- Projects
- Resources

By prefixing these folders with a number, it allows me to apply my own sort so these folders are in the right place every time:

- 01-Projects
- 02-Areas
- 03-Resources
- 04-Archive
