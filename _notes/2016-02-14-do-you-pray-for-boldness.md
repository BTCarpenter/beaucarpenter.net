title: Do you pray for boldness?
---
> Acts 4:29 – And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all **boldness** they may speak thy word,

One of the very first prayer requests of the church was for boldness. We pray for so many things, but how often do we ask God for boldness in simple faith?

We may ask for hearts to be opened, for safety, for fruit, but seldom boldness. What does this reveal about our view of ministry and evangelism? In some ways I believe it shows that we focus so much on the results that we forget the process.

We ask God for the results, but we neglect the process. I don’t think it is that we aren’t reliant upon God, but it is that we neglect even doing the process so we don’t even think to pray for God’s help in the process! The process is speaking the Gospel to people. That is not a comfortable thing, but it is how the work moves forward!

Think about it! When was the last time that I shared the Gospel with someone that I did or did not know? Was it yesterday, last week, last month, can we even remember a specific time? I’m concerned by this in my life. Being a preacher, I talk about God on a regular basis, I teach the Bible, but what about simply sharing Jesus with someone?

This is an area we need to grow in. We cannot neglect it! We need boldness, I need boldness, you need boldness.

When was the last time you prayed for boldness? I challenge you to begin praying for boldness as you serve Him!

**Question: When have you asked God for Boldness and how did you see Him work through you?**
