### Example Salvation Invitation

As believers are praying

I would like to ask you a question, has there been a time when you believed in Jesus?

I didn’t ask if, you’ve been baptized, if you’re a church member, if you’re a good person, have you believed?

Right now, I want to invite you to call on Jesus to save you.

You might pray something like this

Dear Jesus, 

I believe in your death on the cross for my sin,  
I believe in your resurrection proving your power over death,  
I believe in your word that I can call upon you

And you say you’ll save me and change me

Thank you for forgiving my sin and making me yours 

If that’s you today, God says you’ve been made new.

Right after the service, we have a book that we would like put in your hands, come by the next steps table at the back
