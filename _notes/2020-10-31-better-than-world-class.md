There's much to learn from world class performers. Often they bring an unusual level of dedication along with a unique perspective.

Then the thought hits me, "If I'm not in the category of 'world class,' then what can I do that's valuable?"

Here's one of the best answers I've come up with: **I can be personal, I can be there, I can be present.**

The more I think about it, showing up, being present, and being personal are better than world class. We may not be the best in the world, but we can show up for people and be present in their world.
