title: Develop a Scripture Motto

> Finally, my brethren, **be strong** *in the Lord*, and in the power *of his might.* - Ephesians 6:10

Every once in a while, you develop a motto. A statement of truth often forged in a time of difficulty. You can adopt others' sayings, but why not make your own?

In 2022, two elements in this verse began to form a motto for me:

- Strength is commanded. We cannot give up our responsibility to put on strength, stand up, and go forward. "*Be strong*" is an imperative! Christianity is not a weak, wimpy, powerless faith.
- Just as crucial, this strength does not come from my resources. It's not self-generated or self-sustained. You can give it all you have and still come up empty. This strength is "*in the Lord*" and "*of his might*".

Here's my motto:

**I'm not fighting with everything within me**  
**I'm fighting with everything within him**

His strength is my supply. His power is available in my fight. Every day I must renew my dependence upon him.

What's your motto?
