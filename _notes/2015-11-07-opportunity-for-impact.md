title: Opportunity for Impact
---
## An Open Door

In the digital age, your opportunity to **impact others for the cause of Christ has never been greater**. Websites, Blogs, Social Media, Video, Email. All of it has the potential to make a difference in people’s lives. Sadly, we waste this potential. Like the books we buy but never read, it’s pretty much wasted.

This challenge is not just for you; this is for me. **I miss opportunities**, I see all the things that I could be doing if I would only invest a little time. I’ve seen God use missions stories affect my life. I heard these during spare moments in the vast world of the internet.

## The Power of Putting your Story Online

As a teenager, **I ate up what missionaries wrote.** I scoured the internet for their articles. I would even download articles and archive them for later reference! I explored, I wanted to know more. God used these stories and articles to direct me to serve him full time with my life.

## What you write Does matter.

One of the biggest hindrances I have faced in this area is thinking that no one will ever read what I write, so why bother? We have in our minds that unless 1,000 people read my blog, then it was a waste.

**No it’s not!** Even if only a handful of people read what you write, that is still a handful more listening to your message than there was yesterday. It’s worth it.

## Start somewhere!

**You have something to share!** If nothing else, write down and share what God has been teaching you through your daily Bible reading.

One of my all time favorite blogs is [LightInChina.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20200812145728/http://www.worldevangelism.net/opportunity-for-impact/www.lightinchina.org) written by my friend Kanon Bloom. He started it to share what God was doing during his 6-month internship in China, and he continues to write on a regular basis about how God has been at work.

Some of the things he puts on the blog:

- Devotional Thoughts
- Brief Updates about the Ministry
- Pictures from Ministry and China
- Experiences he’s had in the ministry
- Audio Messages
- Videos

You can start anywhere with a blog. Just post something, post at least once a week, and you’re on your way to impacting people for Christ.

**I know this:** one day soon, a young man is going to begin studying at the [Our Generation Training Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20200812145728/http://www.worldevangelism.net/opportunity-for-impact/www.ogtc.info) because he became interested in missions by reading Kanon’s blog.

## Conclusion

With the internet you have a voice, you have a way to share the exciting things that God is doing in your life. Let’s work at it, the more, the merrier!

You have an opportunity to impact lives, **take it.**
