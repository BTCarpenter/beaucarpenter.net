# A New Year is Upon us

2015 almost gone by now. As everyone is coming down off the Christmas high, it’s time to face the new year head on. As I was thinking about this, I realized that I don’t want 2016 to be another humdrum year.

For some reason, I always seem to let the year pass by without taking advantage of the time. When I was younger, older people always told me that time seems to pass by more and more quickly. I’m only 22, but I understand the point. It’s January then you turn around, and it’s tax time, and then you wake up the next morning and it’s the middle of summer, you get ready for bed, and it is already fall.

Time doesn’t actually pass faster, just from our perspectives it does. Consequently, the important question is; How are you going to use the next year that God has given you (Lord willing)?

I want to share some of the decisions I am making.

## Let’s get in God’s Word daily

Now’s the time when everyone’s making their new year’s resolutions, why not plan to read the Bible every day of 2016? We can never get enough of God’s word! I surely don’t know it as well as I could. I want to keep learning and growing. At least plan to read through the Bible once in 2016, for bonus points, go on a 6-month plan and read through twice.

## Let’s serve Him like never before

There is a general rule, as people age, we get slower and less passionate than in our youth. I find that with each year that passes, I more and more want to kick back, relax, and just enjoy life. We’ll do less church because it is so taxing. We won’t attempt great things for God, I mean let’s be honest, most of the time it doesn’t work. What terrible logic! Yet, It constantly tries to invade my thinking!

As the return of Christ is ever imminent, we must be doing all we can to serve him before our time is up!

## Let’s disciple somebody!

I read a book the other day that told about two models of church. Church #1 reached 1,000 people every two years, Church #2 only won and discipled one person for each member every two years. In two years Church #1 went from 30 to 1,030, Church #2 went from 30 to 60.

The obvious choice is to follow Church #1! However, by the numbers Church #2 will surpass Church #1 in 20 years by almost four times! (10,030 vs. 30,720) What does this mean for us? Following Jesus model of discipleship works

It’s easy to have a big church mentality and want to have the great numbers, but Jesus taught us to make committed followers. Eventually, the crowds will be there, but it’s going to start as we invest our lives in a few people and help them grow to the place where they can reproduce another disciple.

It’s time to decide, will 2016 be another so-so year? **Or will 2016 see God work great things through our lives?**
