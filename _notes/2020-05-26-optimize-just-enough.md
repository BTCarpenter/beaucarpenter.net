Continually seeking an easier way of working will get you sidetracked. The most important thing is strapping in and doing the work.

Write, don't Google "Best Minimal Writing Apps."

Writing creates progress. Googling creates motion. It feels like you're moving, but you're not going anywhere.

Find a tool that works well enough and then move on. Once you're making a lot of progress, you can think about optimization.

It's more important at the beginning to start the work than to find the optimal path.
