There are two overwhelming mindsets in many realms of life:

* How much can I consume?
* How much can I contribute?

The consumer is focused on what they receive from the domains of their life. Therefore they become selfish, small, and miserable.

The contributor walks into the room and finds opportunities to give. They show up and pour out and therefore make the world around them better. In giving of themselves, contributors not only make the world better, but they are better off because of it.

So who are you? Consumer or Contributor?
