*The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.*

Proverbs 21:25-26

Laziness doesn’t do anyone any good. The very desire for things kills the lazy man! His spirit is weak, his body is weak, he has no sense of accomplishment. He desires, but without action, he won’t make progress.

Much like desire coupled with laziness, the goal of acquiring things will destroy man’s life as well. The lie is that every new acquisition will make your life better. Unfortunately, this too does not lead to either happiness or fulfillment. Focusing on things is life draining.

On the opposite end of the spectrum is the righteous man. He knows that God loves a cheerful giver. Through generosity his trust in God deepens and he experiences the joy of giving.

Giving serves to continuously align our priorities. It reminds us that things are not eternal. In giving, we are challenged to place our trust in God, not things. 

Life isn't about the amount you can acquire. It's about how you use what God has given you to bless others and honor God.
