In 2011, I opened my first blog. It was my first experience publishing online and for a while I posted every day with thoughts from my Bible reading. It was a learning and growing experience!  

Never before had I been so committed to writing on a regular basis. This exercise had many benefits:  

- Clearer Thinking
- More Concise Speaking
- Better Retention of What I read in my Bible

Alas, I did not continue this publicly after two years or so. I continued writing; once-in-a-while journaling, daily devotions, writing other communications for work.  

This change resulted in a net loss. I lost the challenge of putting my thoughts out in the wild with my name attatched. Somehow, it felt safer to not write on my own site. It also lost some sense of pride in my writing since I had stopped putting my work out.  

I have continued writing quite a bit, but little for the sake of sharing thoughts and experiences to help others.  

### So today is the day

I will publish on this site to serve others ... and because it's kind of fun!  

Topics to expect:

- Thoughts about life and church ministry
- Notes about helpful tools and processes
- Fun stuff once in a while :)

In the meantime, you can follow along on social media or email me a note, I would love to hear from you!
