title: Comparison is a Leech
---
It latches on to the heart and quickly drains us of:

- Happiness and Contentment
- Enthusiasm and Vision
- Strength and Vitality

Pull that thing off as quickly as you can.

Also, take note. 
You might notice these virtues drain away 
before you're even aware of comparing.
