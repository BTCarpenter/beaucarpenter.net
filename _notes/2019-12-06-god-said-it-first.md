There is a genre of authors and speakers who take scientific studies and use them to write practical books that support old wisdom. At times, it becomes almost comical since many of these “new” insights are age old Biblical principles. I will come across a portion and think, "Wow, that sounds just like what God said in His word! It’s not new, but God said it a long time ago."

People are discovering that God knows what He's talking about! Below are three recent examples I’ve found.

## Generosity

It has become a new trend to highlight the place that generosity should have in our lives. They share research that suggests that generous people are happier. They show that those with an abundance mindset are less stressed and tend to be better off financially.

If you read the book of Proverbs, you'll find the same conclusions. Proverbs is a book full of wisdom about generosity and its benefits!

> The liberal soul shall be made fat: And he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Proverbs 11:25

> 25 The desire of the slothful killeth him; For his hands refuse to labour. 26 He coveteth greedily all the day long: But the righteous giveth and spareth not. Proverbs 21:25–26

## Cognitive Biases

Cognitive Biases are errors that cause poor judgment. One interviewee said, "It's important to listen to several wise people who can spot your blind spots and provide outside perspectives to overcome cognitive biases." God talked about this when He said that there is safety in a multitude of counselors!

> Where no counsel is, the people fall: But in the multitude of counsellers there is safety. Proverbs 11:14

## Mental Health

Most recently, I listened to a podcast about treatment centers for mental health. It suggested effective methods to help those struggling with mental health:

- Improving diet for the body to be well-nourished
- Involving people in meaningful work
- Providing a place to connect with others

All of these things are Biblical principles! God calls His people to take care of their bodies. Daniel and his friends were much better off when they had a clean, nourishing diet. God gives His people meaningful work to do. We are laborers together with God in the Great Commission. The church is a body where we connect to God and others!

## Conclusions

You can become very wise by being a student of the Bible. You can do better than the trends by standing on the timeless wisdom of God's word. Bible students should be some of the sharpest people out there; we have a leg up!

My challenge to you: Get in the Bible, trust God, trust what He says, and allow God's wisdom to guide your life.
