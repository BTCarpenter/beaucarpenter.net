## How the Our Generation Summit Impacted my Life

The OG Summit is a powerful winter missions retreat in Pigeon Forge TN. It is an exciting three-day conference designed to help you find your place in World Evangelism.

Enough of the promo, **let me tell you my story.**

**5 years ago**, when I was a junior in high school, I attended my first OG Summit. It was December 29th and I left in my pickup truck and took my first road trip! I didn’t know anyone at the summit, but I decided to go and check it out.

I know, I was a little bit of a crazy person to drive over **450 miles** to attend a conference about missions, but it turned out to be one of the defining points in my life.

At the Music Road Hotel, **I met a group of people who are passionate about carrying the Gospel to the world.** I was challenged to love the Lord and live all out for our God. My life has never been the same since.

More than the speakers, breakout sessions, and attractions, it was **the people I met** that made a profound impact on my life. I found out that it doesn’t take a person who can walk on water to make a difference for God. **Jesus takes normal people and uses them in extraordinary ways** if we will simply trust him and follow him.

I want to challenge you to check it out, to consider taking this step to find your place in God’s plan to get the message of the Gospel to the entire world. You won’t regret it!
