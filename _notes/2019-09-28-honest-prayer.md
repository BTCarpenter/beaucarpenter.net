In reading the Psalms, you'll quickly find that those who wrote the psalms were very much real people with real problems. They were honest with God about their struggles. You'll find questions, repentance, and frustration.

This is encouraging because there is a time to come to God with frustration. You can bring your questions to God. You can be honest with God. That is some of the best advice I have ever received.

With honesty, don't ever get stuck in frustration. The pattern in the Psalms is frustration, then a renewed spirit. Come to God, speak to him, and then allow him to work in you. You'll find that he renews you and leads you into thanksgiving and joy.

Sometimes it takes time, but honest prayer will fix your perspective.
