### Standing on the Rock Sermon Series

We're about half-way through a series on what it is to be "strong in the Lord." This series means so much to me personally as it's an attempt at verbalizing some of the study I've been doing in the background for a few months now.

The messages are available on [Sermon Audio](https://www.sermonaudio.com/search.asp?seriesOnly=true&currSection=sermonstopic&sourceid=visionbaptist&keyword=Standing+on+the+Rock&keyworddesc=Standing+on+the+Rock)

### Camping Season us upon us!

We went on our first camping trip of the season a few weeks ago, Thaddeus & I plus a few friends camped at [River Forks campground](https://www.hallcounty.org/Facilities/Facility/Details/River-Forks-Park-11). Weather was spectacular and the s'mores were gooey, what more can you ask for?

Next trip is to [Vogel State Park](https://gastateparks.org/Vogel), one of our all time favorites!
