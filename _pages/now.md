*Updated November 19th, 2025*

I didn't realize it had been over a year since my last update! Here are a few things going right now:
### Veritas Baptist College

I'm in the middle of my third master's degree course at [Veritas Baptist College](https://www.vbc.edu) on academic research & writing. It's the hardest and best class yet. 

For a while I was stressed with the class (maybe I still am 🤪), but somewhere along the way I realized that I could change my mindset and consider it an opportunity to level-up my skills.

On the reading side of the class, I read some great books on research and writing:

- *Elements of Style* by Strunk & White
- *From Topic to Thesis* by Michael Kibbe
- *On Writing Well* by William Zinsser
- *Writing to Learn* by William Zinsser
- *Revising Prose* by Richard Lanham

For my research topic and paper, I'm researching present aspects of glorification.

### Keyboard Nerdiness

I was dealing with quite a bit of neck/shoulder pain from extended sessions at the computer. In addition to exercise and stretching, I picked up a ZSA Moonlander split keyboard. The form factor helped with my pain and I've been working on some nerdy typing stuff:

- Vim mode in Obsidian.
- Updating my [moonlander layout](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/pXXEd/latest/0) with shortcut keys
- Twitter/X keyboard shortcuts are awesome (Hit `?` to see all)

#### New Responsibilities

At church, I took on responsibility for the music ministry working with a great team of folks to lead and develop our church music.
