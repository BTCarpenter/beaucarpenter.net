### Administrative Pastor

Serving as the Administrative Pastor at [Vision Baptist Church](https://visionbaptist.com). We've just finished up planning for 2023! It's been a good 9 months getting settled into life and ministry here in Alpharetta/Cumming.

### Nerding out on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

I'm fascinated with taking notes and managing tasks in Obsidian. It's a note-taking tool that is based around a few core ideas:
- All notes are stored in plain-text, your data isn't locked up in one tool.
- Note linking is built into the core of Obsidian.
- Functionality can be extended by plugins, [of which there are many](https://obsidian.md/plugins).
This is the only note-taking tool where I find myself naturally resurfacing older, useful information.
