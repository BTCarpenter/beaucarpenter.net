A Lifetime can be viewed in opposite ways.

In one sense, a lifetime is long. At this point in history, one can expect to live 70-80 years. In 1950, the world average life expectancy was 48 years. Today, it is 72 years! In another sense, a lifetime is short. Even 70 years pass quickly, and after this life is the vast expanse of eternity.

The perspective you adopt shapes the way you spend your days. Viewing life as a long span of years highlights the opportunity to build a comfortable life. Alternatively, seeing this lifetime as a speck on the timeline of eternity activates you to live for something beyond this life.

The Bible regularly reminds the Christian to live life on the eternal timeline. However, some factors make it difficult to live consistently with eternity in focus. 

Inwardly:

- Eternity is in the future, and it is unseen 
- Eternity is only understood by faith
- Eternity is brought into focus through fellowship with God

Outwardly:

- Society at large holds a temporal value system in which the Christian is unusual
- Life seemingly ignores, even penalizes those who would live on an eternal timeline
- Fortune sparingly compensates those who would live for eternity

At times in my life, I have found my soul frustrated in the pursuit of living a life that matters in eternity. The frustrations in my soul are echoed in the words of Asaph:

> 2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped.      
> 3 For I was envious at the foolish, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
> Psalm 73:2-3  
  
> 12 Behold, these are the ungodly, Who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
> 13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, And washed my hands in innocency.
> Psalm 73:12-13

Frustration begins when I compare the circumstances of my life to others. Most often, I compare myself with those who have it "better." Through comparison, I wonder if it is worth sacrificing greater comfort to model my life after what God values:

- Is it worth it to give a significant percentage of my income instead of keeping it all for myself?
- Is it worth it to live for the spiritual benefit of others at the expense of my comfort?
- Is it worth it to enter into uncomfortable opportunities to serve God?

Without an eternal perspective, denying comfort and security does not make much sense. However, when I view my life on the timeline of eternity, I can have the confidence needed to live an uncommon life. In Asaph's prayer, he concludes:

> 26 My flesh and my heart faileth: But God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
> 27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
> 28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, That I may declare all thy works.
> Psalm 73:26-28

Fellowship with God enables me to adopt an eternal perspective on life. The eternal perspective activates me to walk by faith and live for the things that matter in eternity. If you're wavering in your decision to live by God's eternal values, fellowship with God, read His Word, and renew an eternal perspective on your life.
