title: Start, Even in a Small Way
---
Have you ever been stuck on a project? 

It's too big to tackle. Perhaps you don't know all the steps. 

**Start, even if it's just a tiny step.**

Writing an article? Start with a few words on the page.
Editing a video? Put the clips on a timeline.
Preparing a sermon? Copy the scripture into a document.
Cleaning out the garage? Throw one thing away.

A little momentum makes all the difference.
